# browserdaddy

Native, local-first macOS browsing-intelligence app — unified cross-browser
history archive + real attention tracking + background link routing +
Chrome and Safari tab inventory.

## Tabs

The LIVE → Tabs workspace lists normal Chrome tabs and regular Safari tabs.
Chrome uses Automation consent and a verified normal-window check. Safari
uses an optional Safari App Extension; enable **BrowserDaddy Safari Tabs** in
Safari → Settings → Extensions and grant website access for the sites you
want listed. The extension discards Private Browsing pages before passing
URLs or titles to BrowserDaddy. No Safari AppleScript access is granted.
Click selects (⌘-click for several),
double-click focuses the real tab, × closes it, and right-click offers Send
to another browser/profile or Copy URL. A move opens the destination before
closing the original tab only after the destination opens. Search filters
title+URL; the list refreshes every 15s while visible. Chrome incognito and
Safari Private Browsing tabs are excluded. Brave remains a link destination,
but its tabs are not listed.

## Link router

Set BrowserDaddy as the macOS default browser (Router workspace → ROUTE, or
System Settings → Desktop & Dock) and clicked links route silently: first
matching rule wins, everything else opens in the configured fallback
browser+profile. BrowserDaddy keeps running without a visible window; its
menu bar icon opens the full app. Rule patterns are case-insensitive: `github.com` also covers
subdomains, `*.corp.dev` globs the host, and any pattern containing `/` globs
the whole URL.

Copy a link in any app and a floating browser menu appears (toggle in Router
→ ACTIONS). A matching rule preselects its target, but nothing opens until
you choose. ⌃⌥O reopens the menu for the copied link; ⌃⌥Space takes the
frontmost Chrome or Brave normal tab to another browser. Safari's current-tab
hotkey is disabled because AppleScript cannot distinguish private windows.
In the picker: arrows + ⏎, digits 1–9, single click, esc or clicking away
dismisses it.

Chromium targets (Chrome, Brave, …) launch with `--profile-directory`, so
rules and the picker can open a specific profile. Profile names are
discovered from `Local State` inside connected browser folders, or typed in
Router → PROFILES. Safari has no profile targeting — a macOS limitation.
Config lives in `meta.router.config` inside the local archive.

## Development

```sh
swift build                    # build all targets
swift test                     # run tests
scripts/run-local.sh           # build + bundle + launch .build/BrowserDaddy.app
scripts/classify-domains.sh    # batch-tag archive domains (opt-in, manual)
scripts/classify-pages.sh      # batch-tag archive pages (opt-in, manual)
```

Layout: `Sources/BrowserCore` (archive, extraction, watcher, report engine,
classifier), `Sources/BrowserDaddy` (SwiftUI app), `SafariTabsExtension`
(privacy-filtered Safari app extension), `Tests/` (XCTest).

Data lives at `~/Library/Application Support/BrowserDaddy/browserdaddy.db`.
See PRODUCT.md for scope and AGENTS.md for boundaries.

## First launch

Onboarding runs once: read-only folder selection for each browser you choose,
Chrome Automation consent for qualified normal-window tab capture, and an
optional topic-tagging opt-in. Browser folder grants are stored as revocable,
app-scoped security bookmarks. Full Disk Access is neither requested nor
required. Archive extraction runs on boot and every 6h; the focus watcher runs
while the app is alive.

Classification (classifier.dev) is the app's only network call and only
runs when you allow it — in onboarding or via Permissions → TAGGING.
Everything else is on-device.

History search composes browser, profile, date-range, category and tag-state
filters. Click a visit to expand its local evidence, then use **Retag** to apply
or clear a page, exact-domain or whole-site override. Local retagging never calls
classifier.dev and never modifies the browser's own history. Optional external
classification remains a separate consent-gated action in Permissions.

The current consent discloses domain names, truncated page titles and URL paths.
These requests are not anonymous: text can contain personal information and the
service receives the network address. URL credentials, query strings and fragments
are excluded. Old consent requires renewal. Opt-out cancels active requests and
remaining batches, but cannot recall data already sent. Existing local tags remain.

Use `scripts/run-local.sh --preview-fixture` for a synthetic History workspace
that contains no personal browsing data.

## Native release

Tracking: https://github.com/sarthakagrawal927/browserdaddy/issues/3

Build and test with XcodeBuildMCP using this Swift package path. Set session
configuration to Release and build arm64 + x86_64. Verify both Mach-O minimum
OS versions and architectures before using `scripts/package-release.py`.
The protected GitHub release workflow builds verified universal Release products,
signs and notarizes an exact tagged candidate, signs its appcast with the protected
Sparkle key, and retains the checked artifact. A manual dispatch on `main` then
deploys that artifact and appcast to the app-owned Worker, verifies the live bytes,
publishes the GitHub release, and records the site manifest on `main`. The
`production-release` environment requires approval; ordinary pushes run candidate
CI only.
The script requires a fresh output directory and an existing Developer ID identity;
it signs an isolated candidate, never installs or publishes it. Notarization,
stapling, Gatekeeper checks and native runtime qualification are separate gates.
Release bundles use `com.significanthobbies.browserdaddy`; development uses `.dev`.
Moving from development to release may require new user-granted permissions.
The release is sandboxed. `Support/container-migration.plist` moves the existing
BrowserDaddy Application Support folder into the stable app container on its
first sandboxed launch; packaging must retain that resource. Release qualification
must take a recoverable backup before that first launch.

Until the app holds its own grants, the python launchd agents stay as
backstop collectors. Retire them once verified:
`launchctl bootout gui/$UID/com.browserdaddy.watch` and
`com.browserdaddy.extract`.
